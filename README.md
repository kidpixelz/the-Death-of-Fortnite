# the Death of Fortnite
## Problem Statement:
In this project we wanted to figure if the game Fortnite was really dying in 2020 after its release in 2017. We wanted to look into the search results of user amount to determine if Fortnite was really dying in the year 2020.  
## Why is this interesting?:
Fortnite is a well known game and it’s making epic games, the greater of fortnite a lot of money so looking into to this will also give us a hint of how much of an impact the popularity of fornite has on epic gamers and the gaming scene. It’s also interesting because the game got popular over night and there were no signs of it slowing down so it would be shocking to see Fortnite’s undone.
## What data have you looked at and why does this data answers the question?
We started to look into further data as, “ Which other games could be competitive to Fortnite?” , “ What is their player count?” or even how much money they we’re also making. But, what we really focused on is on how other games player count can beat th Fortnite player count. 
## Conclusions from the data:
The game is popular but its not what it used to be. The growth rate isn't constant anymore and in recent years the search rates looks unstable with spikes and lows occurring often which shows the big behemoth is now aging and isn't prone to attacks. Fortnite’s peak is behind us and after every spike in its popularity the numbers go down and if this trend continues the game will be forgotten and non existent in the mainstream but in the hearts of loyal royale fans, fortnite will live on forever and explosive just like bright bomber.
## What you learned:
In our quest to finding out weather or not fortnite is dying we gained some valuable new skills along the way. The most important skill we learned was python 3 as we can use it in future research and experiments but it was also really helpful to learn about github as we can use it to our advantage when pursuing a career in this field later on in our lives.
